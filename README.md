# hello-world
It is our final project for the class The Great Transition. Our final project is an app to tackle the issue of loneliness. 
Our group is named Group E and the members of the team are : Marie-Antoinette LESCUYER, Yeseul OH, Axel UDAVE, Abdelwahhab AL BAKRI & Delphine GODIN. 
We choose to write a 5-page essay in order to add further details and information about our project and to create a website that is an app which aims at tackling the issue of loneliness.
